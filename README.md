> Remarkably crude tool for looking through bundles to get a module

Sadly bundlers have made using JS from the console essentially impossible. In an attempt to wrest something- anything- back from this terrible state of affairs, I spent a couple hours hacking out what I could with this module.

It's utter garbage and bad and barely works.
